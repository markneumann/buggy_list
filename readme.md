### Server Side:
- Unable to login, trying to login with undefined. *
- schema for bucketlists not found in mongoose *
- name Schema not defined *
- then for $http.get('/users') not firing! ** (***) // this feels like it should be client side but its not!
- My server can't seem to find my routes file! *

### Client side:
- Angular app cannot find my userfactory *
- routeParams cannot find id. ***
- Angular-route not defined *
-factory bucketlist doesn't seem to be registering on my controllers. **
- submitting a newlist from my dashboard doesn't seem to be firing its ng-click! :( **  this could be easily fixed...
